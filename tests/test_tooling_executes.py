"""Guard the tooling surface that the artefact suites do not exercise.

Why this test exists: a repo-wide line-ending repair accidentally added `newline=""` to
`Path.read_text` calls in tools/cli_smoke.py. `Path.read_text` does not accept that keyword, so the
CLI smoke runner crashed with TypeError. Nothing caught it: the unit suite does not execute
tools/*.py, and the independent checker was (correctly) told not to run tools that write into the
repo. A whole directory of executable tooling was therefore unverified.

These tests are cheap and execute the tooling for real.
