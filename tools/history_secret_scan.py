"""Scan BOTH the working tree and the git history for token-like strings (R-AUD-014 / FW-11).

Output discipline (non-negotiable): this tool prints ONLY counts and non-sensitive status codes.
It never prints a matched value and never a token prefix. The output artefact may contain pattern
names and per-file/per-object counts but no secret material.

Runs as its own process on purpose: an in-kernel import cache had once recorded pattern names from a
superseded revision of workspace.py, so the artifact disagreed with the source it claimed to
describe. Recorded facts must come from the revision being described.
