"""S0/S1 — materialise the 22 source-designated Technology Admission rulings (PKG-00 §9).

The source terminalises a DESIGN disposition for CAND-01..CAND-22; it does NOT license-verify or
execute them. This tool therefore never invents a PASS and never inflates a denominator: it records
the source state for every required column and computes the per-row verdict from the artefact.

Audit repair (R-AUD-007 / MUT-TECH-PIN, WO-TS-req-pipd-r3-fw-08):

* every one of the 22 rows carries an exact source pin (repository + version/commit, or the literal
  ``UNAVAILABLE`` together with a machine-readable reason), a licence field (or an explicit
  unknown-licence disposition that BLOCKS activation), a TTL/security note, a fallback, an exit
  criterion, a permission scope, a provider-off behaviour, and a per-row disposition from exactly
  ``{ADOPT, REFERENCE, EVAL_ONLY, QUARANTINE, REJECT}``;
* a row is reported ``active``/``installed`` ONLY when its disposition is ``ADOPT`` AND it carries a
  verified pin AND a known (non-unknown) licence. A non-ADOPT disposition can NEVER be reported as
  active/installed;
* ``--report`` recomputes the per-row verdict from the artefact and prints the TRUE denominator per
  gate (an honest ``0/22`` for ``G-TECH-SOURCE-PIN`` stays ``0/22``), and exits non-zero when any
  row claims active without a verified pin or with an unknown licence.

Everything is parsed from the source clause, so the records cannot drift from the clause they cite.
Where the source legitimately returns a family of dispositions (``ADOPT_WITH_WRAPPER``,
``ADOPT_WITH_TRANSLATION``), the design disposition is normalised to the canonical per-row
disposition ``ADOPT`` and the exact source string is preserved in ``upstream_disposition``.
